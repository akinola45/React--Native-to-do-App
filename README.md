# Title Of SWEP project
 Minimalistic To Do App

# Introduction

This is a to-do app project made using React Native Expo, I know what you are thinking,
this is just a simple to-do app but this one is different!
let me explain:
 this cool app allows users to mark tasks as completed or incompleted in a user-friendly way.

## Dependencies

```
expo install expo-notifications

expo install expo-constants

yarn add @react-native-community/datetimepicker

yarn add @react-navigation/native-stack

yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit redux react-redux

yarn add moment
```

## Conclusion

As you can see after mentioning all the features that this app has it does not seem very simple anymore.
That is why I think this is a great project for the SWEP programme done in my university.
